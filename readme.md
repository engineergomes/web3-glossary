A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between the price and the supply of a token. When a token is bought, the funds go into a pool and new tokens are minted, moving the price along the curve. When tokens are sold, they are burnt and the seller receives funds from the pool. This mechanism is used in some automated market makers and token distribution models. **__[More Info](https://medium.com/coinmonks/token-bonding-curves-in-practice-3eb904720cb8)__**

## **Token Vesting**

Token vesting is a way of distributing tokens over time, to ensure that they are not all sold or used at once. This is often used in ICOs and other token sales, where the team or early investors are given tokens that vest over a certain period. This is to incentivize the team to continue working on the project, and to reduce the risk of the market being flooded with tokens all at once.

## **Indexer**

In the context of blockchain, an indexer is a node that indexes blockchain data, making it searchable and easily accessible. Indexers play a crucial role in blockchain networks, as they allow other participants to quickly and efficiently find the data they need. **__More Info__**

## **Lending Protocol**

A lending protocol is a set of rules programmed into a smart contract that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain. These protocols have been popularized by the DeFi movement, and they allow users to earn interest on their crypto holdings and take out loans in a decentralized and permissionless way. Popularized by AAVE, Compound & even MakerDAO.

## **Treasury**

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a treasury refers to a pool of funds that a decentralized organization (DAO) or a protocol holds. These funds are typically used for protocol development, community initiatives, liquidity provision, and other activities that benefit the ecosystem. The management and allocation of these funds are usually governed by the token holders of the protocol.

## **Governance Process**

In a blockchain context, the governance process refers to the mechanisms by which decisions are made within a decentralized network or organization. This can include decisions about code changes, protocol upgrades, resource allocation, and other key aspects of the network. The governance process is typically carried out through a system of voting, with votes weighted by the number of tokens a user holds.

## **Launchpad**

A launchpad in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies refers to a platform that facilitates the launch of new projects or tokens. These platforms often provide a range of services to projects, including fundraising, marketing, and advisory services. In return, they often receive a portion of the project's tokens or other forms of compensation.

## **Private Round**

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a private round is a fundraising method where a project sells its tokens to a select group of investors before they are available to the general public. These investors are typically venture capital firms, hedge funds, and high-net-worth individuals. The terms of these sales, including the price and vesting schedule of the tokens, are usually negotiated between the project and the investors.

## **__[Reserve Currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reservecurrency.asp)__**

A reserve currency is a large quantity of currency maintained by central banks and other major financial institutions to prepare for investments, transactions, and international debt obligations, or to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are priced in the reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods. Holding a reserve currency minimizes exchange rate risk, as the purchasing nation will not have to exchange its currency for the reserve currency to make the purchase. Since 1944, the U.S. dollar has been the primary reserve currency used by other countries. As a result, foreign nations closely monitor the monetary policy of the United States to ensure that the value of their reserves is not adversely affected by inflation or rising prices.

## **__[Prediction Markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market)__**

Prediction markets are speculative platforms where individuals can place bets on the outcome of future events, such as elections, commodity prices, or even changes in the weather. These markets are designed to aggregate information and generate predictions about future events based on the wisdom of the crowd. In the context of blockchain, prediction markets are often built using smart contracts on Ethereum.

## **Liquidity Incentives**

Liquidity incentives are rewards given to users who provide liquidity to a protocol. These incentives can come in various forms, such as additional tokens or higher yields. The goal of liquidity incentives is to attract more users to provide liquidity, which can help to stabilize prices and reduce slippage in decentralized exchanges.

## **Vote-Locked Token**

Vote-locked tokens are a type of token that users lock up in order to gain voting rights in a protocol's governance system. The longer the tokens are locked up, the more voting power the user gains. This mechanism is designed to ensure that those who have a long-term commitment to the protocol have a greater influence over its governance.

## **Halal**

Halal refers to what is permissible or lawful in traditional Islamic law. It is frequently applied to permissible food and drinks, but can also apply to a wide range of other activities including financial activities. In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a halal cryptocurrency would be one that is compliant with Islamic law. This can be a complex issue, as it involves considerations of the nature of money, the permissibility of speculative investments, and the prohibition of interest in Islamic law.

## **DEX Aggregator**

A DEX aggregator is a platform that sources liquidity from various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in order to provide users with the best possible trading rates. DEX aggregators work by routing trade orders across multiple DEXs, splitting the order if necessary, to minimize price impact and provide the best possible trade execution.

## **Volume**

In the context of cryptocurrency, volume is the amount of a particular asset traded in a certain period of time. Trading volume can give an investor an idea of the price direction and the strength of that price direction. High trading volumes are often associated with the start of new trends in price.

## **Revenue**

In the context of a blockchain project or protocol, revenue refers to the income that the project or protocol generates, often through transaction fees, service fees, or other mechanisms. Revenue models in blockchain projects can be complex and varied, and may involve various forms of tokenomics.

## **Buy Back and Burn**

Buy back and burn is a strategy used by some blockchain projects where a portion of the supply of a token is bought back from the market and then destroyed or "burned". This reduces the total supply of the token, which can increase scarcity and potentially lead to an increase in price.

## **Revenue Sharing**

Revenue sharing in the context of blockchain and DeFi often involves distributing a portion of the revenue generated by a protocol back to the token holders or liquidity providers. This can be done as a way to incentivize participation in the protocol and reward those who are contributing to its success.

## **NFT Marketplace**

An NFT marketplace is a platform where non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be bought, sold, and traded. These platforms provide a place for creators to mint and list their NFTs, and for collectors and investors to browse, bid on, and purchase NFTs. Examples of NFT marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, and NBA Top Shot.

## **Limit Order**

A limit order is a type of order to purchase or sell a token at a specified price or better. For buy limit orders, the order will be executed only at the limit price or a lower one, while for sell limit orders, the order will be executed only at the limit price or a higher one. This gives the trader control over the price at which the trade is executed, however, the trade is not guaranteed to be executed if the market price does not reach the limit price.

## **Matching Engine**

A matching engine is the core technology component of a cryptocurrency exchange that works in the background to make trades happen. It is responsible for matching up buy and sell orders, executing trades, and maintaining the order book.

## **Dark Pool**

A dark pool is a private financial forum or exchange for trading securities, derivatives, and other financial instruments. Liquidity on these markets is intentionally not fully transparent, i.e., the sizes and prices of orders are not revealed to other participants. Dark pools are often used by large institutional investors to conceal their trading activities from the public and from high-frequency traders.

## **OTC (Over The Counter)**

Over-the-counter (OTC) trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed. OTC trading is common in certain markets such as forex and commodities derivatives.

## **On-ramp/Off-ramp**

In the context of cryptocurrency, an on-ramp is a service that allows you to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency, while an off-ramp is a service that allows you to convert cryptocurrency back into fiat. These services are essential for bringing new users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem and for allowing users to exit the ecosystem when they need to.

## **VRF (Verifiable Random Function)**

A verifiable random function (VRF) is a cryptographic primitive that maps inputs to verifiable pseudorandom outputs. It's a function that generates a random number in such a way that the output can be verified by anyone, but the randomness can only be generated by the holder of a private key. VRFs are used in various blockchain protocols to ensure fair, random selection processes, such as the selection of validators in proof-of-stake networks.

## **VDF (Verifiable Delay Function)**

A verifiable delay function (VDF) is a cryptographic primitive that requires a specified amount of time to compute, but can be verified quickly. VDFs are used in various blockchain protocols to ensure that certain processes cannot be sped up by parallel computing.

## **Chain-lock**

Chain-lock is a security feature that prevents reorganization of the blockchain after a certain depth of block confirmations. It provides enhanced security against 51% attacks.

## **Merge-mining**

Merge-mining, also known as Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW), is the process of two different cryptocurrencies based on the same algorithm being mined simultaneously. This allows a miner to put their computational power to work on multiple blockchains at the same time. The benefit of merge-mining is that it can increase security and decentralization, as the same work is counted towards multiple networks.

## **TGE (Token Generation Event)**

A Token Generation Event (TGE) is a process where a new cryptocurrency token is created and distributed to participants. It's often associated with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), where the tokens are sold to investors as a way to raise funds for the project. During a TGE, the project's smart contract will generate the tokens and distribute them according to the rules set out in the contract.

## **Foundation**

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency, a foundation is a non-profit organization that is established to promote and support a particular blockchain project. Foundations are often responsible for the governance and development of the project, and they can play a key role in setting the strategic direction of the project. Examples of blockchain foundations include the Ethereum Foundation and the Stellar Development Foundation.

## **Flash Loan Exploit**

A flash loan exploit is a type of attack where an attacker borrows a large amount of cryptocurrency in a flash loan, manipulates the market, and then pays back the loan in the same transaction, often making a large profit. This is possible due to the uncollateralized nature of flash loans.

## **Phishing**

Phishing is a type of online scam where criminals send an email that appears to be from a legitimate company and ask you to provide sensitive information. This is usually done by including a link that will appear to take you to the company’s website to fill in your information – but the website is a clever fake and the information you provide goes straight to the crooks behind the scam. **__[More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)__**

## **Trojan**

In computing, a Trojan horse, or Trojan, is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.

## **Keylogging**

Keylogging, often referred to as keystroke logging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. This is often used by attackers to capture sensitive information like passwords. **__[More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging)__**

## **Social Engineering**

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This is a type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access. **__[More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))__**

## **Impermanent Loss**

This is a loss that liquidity providers can experience when providing liquidity to AMMs. It happens when the price of the tokens in the liquidity pool changes compared to when they were deposited. The loss becomes "permanent" if the liquidity provider withdraws their stake when the prices are different.

## **Composability**

This is the ability for different DeFi protocols to interact and build on each other. It's often referred to as "money legos" and is a key feature of the DeFi ecosystem.

## **Risk Management**

## **__[Error Handling](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/solidity/#error-handling)__**

Solidity uses state-reverting exceptions to handle errors. Such exceptions will undo all changes made to the state in the current call (and all its sub-calls) and also flag an error to the caller.

## **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**

**__[RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)__** is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. In the context of blockchain, RPC is often used to interact with nodes in the network. For example, Bitcoin provides a JSON-RPC interface for interaction with its network.

## **CPU Power**

In the context of Bitcoin, **__[CPU power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)__** refers to the computational resources required to mine new blocks. The more CPU power a miner has, the higher their chances of solving the proof-of-work problem and adding a new block to the blockchain.

## **Timestamp Server**

A **__[timestamp server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping)__** works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash. This proves that the data must have existed at the time in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

## **Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)**

**__[Simplified Payment Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Simplified_chain_of_ownership)__** is a method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block. The method is used by some lightweight clients.

## **__[Finney Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finney_attack)__**

A Finney attack is a fraudulent double-spending attack on the Bitcoin network. It is the fraudulent spending of the same coins twice by pre-mining a block and spending the same coins before releasing the block to invalidate that transaction.

## **__[Deanonymisation of Clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network#Deanonymisation_of_clients)__**

Deanonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source. In the context of Bitcoin, it refers to the potential for transactions to be traced back to the individuals who made them, despite the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin addresses. This can be done through various methods, such as IP address tracking, transaction graph analysis, and even physical surveillance.

## **__[WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)__**

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers but can be used by any client or server application. In the context of blockchain, WebSockets are often used for real-time updates of blockchain events, such as new transactions or blocks.

## **State Transition System**

A state transition system is a concept used in the Ethereum blockchain to describe the process of changing from one state to another state. In Ethereum, the state is made up of all account balances, smart contract code and where it's stored, and where all the data of these smart contracts are stored. A state transition is a valid transaction that brings the Ethereum network from one state to another.

## **Turing-Completeness**

A system of data-manipulation rules is said to be Turing complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. Ethereum's programming language, Solidity, is Turing complete, meaning it can solve any computational problem given enough resources.

## **Messages and Transactions**

In Ethereum, the term 'transaction' is used to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account. 'Message' refers to the data sent between two contract accounts.

## **__[Coinbase Transaction](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Coinbase)__**

The first transaction in a block. It is a unique type of bitcoin transaction that can be created by a miner. The miners use it to collect the block reward for their work and any other transaction fees collected by the miner are also sent in this transaction.

## **__[Externally Owned Account (EOA)](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-wallet-vs-account-whats-the-difference)__**

In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (controlled by private keys) and contract accounts (controlled by their contract code). An EOA is controlled by a private key, and if you own the private key associated with the EOA, you have the ability to send ether and messages from it.

## **__[Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script)__**

Bitcoin uses a scripting system for transactions. Scripts can be used to specify the conditions that must be satisfied for a transaction to be spent.

## **__[Merkle-Patricia Trees](https://eth.wiki/fundamentals/patricia-tree)__**
